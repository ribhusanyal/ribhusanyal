      <h1>About Ribhu Sanyal</h1>
      <p>Ribhu Sanyal (born 1983) is an upcoming Dhrupad singer. His interest in music grew from childhood by frequently listening to Late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar.

      <p>Along with his Software Engineering studies, he successfully completed a senior diploma in vocal music from the Faculty of Performing Arts, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, and a graduate diploma from Prayag Sangeet Samiti, Allahabad. Along with his academic studies, he continued his practice of Alap, Dhrupad, and Dhamar genre of Indian classical music with his father from time to time.</p>

      <p>Currently, he resides in Bangalore, India, as a Project Manager by vocation, but he is continuing his musical journey, performing all over India as a Dhrupad soloist and also as a junior partner of his illustrious father in prominent concert platforms in India.</p>
